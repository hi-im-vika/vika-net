# vika-net
This is a simple C++ networking library created for my embedded projects.
## Why?
While using the UDP library from Boost, I found that there was an unexplained delay when transmitting UDP packets. I also didn't have the time to learn how to use other libraries that I felt weren't completely suited for my purpose, so I wrote my own.
